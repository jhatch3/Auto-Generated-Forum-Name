# About
- Used to automatically generate specific names for Adobe forums.
- Using JS, Adobe, buttons, and properties to give unique names based on inputted details.

# Updates 
- Research Done
- General Script completed, with saving properties in progress. Works on the host machine but not on any other.

# Work Cited
- Scripts made by SAR Solutions of Sars Solutions on Youtube. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zoL-lIukb4).

# What I have learned
- This was my first experience coding for an employer, and I was happy to take on the project. Although the scripts I used were sourced from SAR Solutions (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zoL-lIukb4), I gained a lot of valuable insights. I learned about the  process of collaborating with someone to understand and meet project requirements, especially when working with clients who arenâ€™t familiar with coding. This was quite different from working on assignments provided by my computer science professors, where the expectations were clear.

- Additionally, I had to conduct my own research without slides or direct guidance. As a second-year student with limited exposure to JavaScript and its use within Adobe products, I quickly familiarized myself with Adobe forums and the required scripting. In a single day, I was able to grasp the JavaScript concepts needed, understand the SAR Solutions scripts, and modify them to meet my needs. Overall, it was a rewarding project, though it might face challenges if every machine requires an admin login to execute the script.


# TODO 
- Fix saving logic. To work on all machines without needing test.js script. This is because you need admin permission to add it, causing a logical nightmare.
