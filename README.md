# About
- Used to automatically generate specific names for Adobe forums.
- Using JS, Adobe, buttons, and properties to give unique names based on inputted details.

# Updates 
- Research Done
- General Script completed, with saving properties in progress. Works on the host machine but not on any other.

# Work Cited
- Scripts made by SAR Solutions of Sars Solutions on Youtube. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zoL-lIukb4).

# What I have learned
- This was my first time coding for an employer, and I was excited to tackle this project. Although the scripts were taken from SAR Solutions (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zoL-lIukb4), I still learned a lot of valuable things. Such as the back and forths of working with someone and getting all the necessary needs of a project from someone who does not necessarily code. This is a lot different than looking at a canvas project written by my C.S. professors and knowing what is asked. As well, I had to do my own research, no slides to go look back at. Only in my second year, I have yet to learn about JS and use it within Adobe. Within a day's time, I had learned all about Adobe forums, and the JS needed. I was able to understand the Scrip SAR Solutions provided and was able to make the changes needed to satisfy my needs. Overall a great project, but might be a dead end if every machine needs admin login to run script.

# TODO 
- Fix saving logic. To work on all machines without needing test.js script. This is because you need admin permission to add it, causing a logical nightmare.
